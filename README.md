# 📸 Deathshot

A tiny Minecraft mod that automatically captures your final moments! Every time you die, Deathshot takes a screenshot and saves it along with your coordinates.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Automatically takes screenshots when you die
- 📍 Records the exact coordinates of your death
- 💬 Sends you a clickable message to open the screenshot
- 📁 Organizes screenshots in a dedicated "death-shots" folder
- 🎮 Client-side only - works on any server!

## 🔧 Installation

1. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 1.21.4
2. Download the Deathshot mod
3. Place the .jar file in your `mods` folder
4. Launch Minecraft and start dying! (in-game, of course 😉)

## 📸 How it Works

When you die, Deathshot will:
- Take a screenshot of your final moment
- Save it in `.minecraft/death-shots/`
- Show you a chat message with:
    - A link to open the screenshot
    - The coordinates where you died

The screenshots are named with the date, time, and coordinates for easy reference!
